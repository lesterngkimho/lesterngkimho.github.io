Hi! I'm Lester, a software engineer based in Malaysia. I enjoy building software applications and exploring new technologies.

With experience in both frontend and backend development, I am passionate about solving problems and creating impactful digital solutions.

When I'm not coding, I like to read, learn new skills, and contribute to open source projects.

When I'm not doing anything IT-related, I like to drive around the city and explore some random things.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss technology, collaboration, or just to say hello!
